# Learn Something New

# Description 
"Learn Something New" is a web application that allows users to make flashcards. Making flashcards is a helpful way for people to learn new vocabulary quickly. You simply speccify the topic, term, and definition in the correct fields provided in the app, click submit, and flash card will be generated. This app is an authenticated app requiring users to login, which makes sure users only see the cards they create. 
 
## Mock-up

To use this app, you must first sign up by entering an email and a password. You will then be redirected to the welcome page for your account. On this page, you can make flash cards by adding a topic, term, and definition and clicking submit. Once submitted, you will see a rectangular card below with the name of the topic you chose. If you click on this topic, cards in the quiz section below will appear. Any card with the same topic will appear below, so if there are ten terms with the same topic, 10 cards will apear. Hovering over the card will trigger it to flip over. The idea here is that you make a guess of the definiton, and then hover over and see the definition. If you were correct, click the correct button, and the term will show up under the Correct section, or click incorrect and it will show up in the incorrect section. You can also delete terms and they will disappear. Whether you click correct, incorrect, or delete, the flash card will be removed from the DOM. You can click other topics and cards will be appended to the bottom of the page.
